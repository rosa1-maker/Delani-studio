<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>I used the HTML to create the details of my project. It clearly made it possible for me to layout my work in a clean manner as well as the spacing and the indentation.</p>

<p>Then the CSS was to style the elements in the HTML. It has allowed me to secify the positioning , the color, the size , the padding etc of my work.</p>

<p>I also used javascript, jquery and bootstrap.Javascript is to enable me create the backend while bootstrap helped in making the site responsive.</p>

<p>After creating the project I used the git tool to host my project in my GitHub account.</p>

<p>In simpler language I used</p>
<ul>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Git</li>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>JQuery</li>
<h2>Gratitude</h2>
<p>To God for giving me the opportinity to be able to have my breath every day. </p>
<p>To all the technicall mentors who have always journeyed with me unstucking me with my difficulties.</p>
<p>The creators of Visual studio Code, Git and GitHub. Developers of the HTML and the CSs languages.</p>
